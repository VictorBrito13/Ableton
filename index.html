                Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use Live and Push every day. We come from a wide range
                of cultural and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are self-taught, and most of us are somewhere in between.
                What connects us is the shared belief that each of us has the skills and knowledge to contribute to something big: helping to
                shape the future of music culture.

                We’ve learned that achieving the best results comes from building teams that are richly diverse, and thus able to explore
                problems from a wider set of perspectives. We don’t always agree with each other, but opinion and debate are valued and openly

                supported in acquiring new knowledge and skills, and coached on applying these in their daily work. In addition,
                staff-organized development and music salons are a chance to discuss new technologies, production techniques and best practices.

                as well as generous maternity and paternity leave. Office hours are flexible, but it’s not all work; we have several company
